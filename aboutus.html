                We work with local officials and community leaders to improve social services and support systems for
                the elderly and children who are at risk. By making more people aware of the problems they face, we want
                to change policies and get tools that meet their needs well. We help people in need with things like
                food, clothes, and a place to live. We can also help with housework, repairs, or just be there for
                someone to talk to and offer mental support.
