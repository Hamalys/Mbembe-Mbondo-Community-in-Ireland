### Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera browsers.

Steps to test:

1. Open browser and navigate to Mbembe mbondo- community-in ireland "https://hamalys.github.io/Mbembe-Mbondo-Community-in-Ireland/"
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
3. Set to responsive and decrease width to 320px
4. Set the zoom to 50%
5. Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width

Expected:

There are no pixelated or stretched pictures on the website, and it works well on all screen sizes.

You can't scroll horizontally.

There are no overlapping parts.

What happened:

Everything about the website worked as it should have, except for when Mozilla Firefox switched to landscape view. Check out [Unfixed Bugs] for more information.Bugs that haven't been fixed

There were no problems with how the website responded when it was opened on the following devices:

- Nokia C21 Pro

- Apple iPhone SE

— Galaxy Tab S

## Deployments

## Maintaining Versions

I used Visual Studio Code to make the site, and then I pushed it to GitHub to the "tacos-travels" remote project.

People worked on the project and pushed code to the remote repository using the following git commands:

You used the command "git add "file" to add the file(s) to the staging area before committing them.

This statement, "git commit -m "commit message", saved the changes to the local repository queue so they could be used in the next step.
It was used to push all the code that had been written to the remote repository on GitHub with the "git push" command.
Use of Github Pages for Development
—GitHub Pages was used to publish the site. Following are the steps to deploy:

- Go to the Settings tab in the GitHub folder.
— On the left, click "Pages" from the menu.

  - Choose the Branch thing from the drop-down choice in the source section: main

  - Press "Save."

  —When the document is published properly, a live link will show up in a green banner.
  
Visit <https://hamalys.github.io/Mbembe-Mbondo-Community-in-Ireland/>  to see the current link.

To copy the code from the repository locally,
Visit the GitHub repository that you want to copy and use locally:

- Clink on the code button

- Press the HTTPS button

- Cut and paste the reference to the archive

In the next step, you need to install Git, so open your favourite IDE.

For example, in the IDE prompt, type git clone copied-git-url.

It's now possible to use the project on your local computer because it has been copied.
