                    The Mbondo tribe, also known as the Mbembe and the Babembe,
                    lives predominantly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
                    It is essential to note that Africa is home to numerous ethnic groups,
                    each with its own culture, history, and traditions.
                    The Bembe tribe is just one of the many diverse and intriguing
                    ethnic groups that contribute to the cultural richness of the African continent.

                    Our mission is to help the elderly and young children who can't help themselves on the street

                    to ensure our efforts align with the community's requirements and to maximize our impact.
                    Together, we can build a society that becomes more inclusive and compassionate towards those in
                    need.

                    We advocate for enhanced social services and support systems for the elderly
                    and vulnerable children with local authorities and community leaders.

                    we aim to influence policies and resources that effectively address their needs.
                    We provide practical assistance to those in need, such as food, clothing, and shelter.
                    Additionally, we offer help with domestic chores, repairs,
                    or simply companionship and emotional support.
